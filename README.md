# Transfer-Learning-in-Keras

In this repository, you will get the interfacing implemention of DenseNet-121 model with transfer learning in keras.
By using the transfer learning techniques, here we classify our Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. I have classify the 
exudates(infected fundus image) and normal fundus images. This classification is mainly binary class classification.
Our transfer_learning model shown a good training and testing accuracy by successfully classifying the mentioned classes.
